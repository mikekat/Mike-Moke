Autopoiesis

The first programme (autopoiesis.py) takes as inputs :
1)number of time steps,
2)disintegration rate,
3)length (n) of the (n times n) grid,
4)n^2 states corresponding to the nodes of the grid.

The second programme (autopoiesis1.py) takes as inputs :
1)number of time steps,
2)disintegration rate,
3)length (n) of the (n times n) grid.
Then it creates a grid full of S particles with a K particle at the middle.

In both cases we g
The fist one is sufficient to test our code on small lengths.
For the needs of the project we should create a list of different grids that the programme can access and run.
