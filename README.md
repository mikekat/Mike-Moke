Autopoiesis

The first program (autopoiesis.py) takes as inputs :
1)number of time steps,
2)disintegration rate,
3)length (n) of the (n times n) grid,
4)n^2 states corresponding to the nodes of the grid.

The second program (autopoiesis1.py) takes as inputs :
1)number of time steps,
2)disintegration rate,
3)length (n) of the (n times n) grid.
Then it creates a grid full of S particles with a K particle at the middle.

The test file shows 100 time steps from one run of autopoiesis1.py
